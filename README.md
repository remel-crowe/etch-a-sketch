#Etch-a-Sketch Project
Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Etch-a-Sketch project repository. I had a blast building this using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm excited to share it with you.

Overview
This is a simple web-based Etch-a-Sketch application where you can let your creativity run wild. Just like the classic toy, you can draw and erase by navigating your cursor around the grid.

Features
User-Friendly Interface: The clean and intuitive design makes it easy for anyone to jump in and start doodling.
Grid System: The drawing area is divided into a grid, allowing for more precise and organized artwork.
Dynamic Drawing: Choose your colors and start sketching. The dynamic drawing feature enhances the user experience.
Screenshots
Insert some screenshots here to showcase the application in action. You might want to include different stages of a drawing or highlight specific features.
