# Etch-a-Sketch Project

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Etch-a-Sketch project repository. I had a blast building this using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm excited to share it with you.

## Overview

This is a simple web-based Etch-a-Sketch application where you can let your creativity run wild. Just like the classic toy, you can draw and erase by navigating your cursor around the grid.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The clean and intuitive design makes it easy for anyone to jump in and start doodling.
- **Grid System:** The drawing area is divided into a grid, allowing for more precise and organized artwork.
- **Dynamic Drawing:** Choose your colors and start sketching. The dynamic drawing feature enhances the user experience.
